# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of
# the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of
